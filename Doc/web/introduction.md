Freecash is an improved version of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin framework. It inherits Bitcoin's UTXO model, POW, sha256 mining algorithm, and Schnorr signature algorithm.

The following modifications have been made: 1) 1-minute block time, 2) 100 million total supply, 3) dynamic difficulty adjustment, 4) 30-block anti-reorganization protection, 5) 10-day mining output maturation period, 6) mining output reduction of 20% per year, 7) coinbase output governance fund, 8) 100-day governance fund maturation period, 9) governance fund reduction of 50% per year.

The main function of Freecash is providing the necessary infrastructure for the decentralized crypto society. This function is based on UTXO, OP_RETURN, and CoinDays Bitcoin framework. Basic protocols have been established, including identity, reputation, protocols, services, codes, applications, groups,teams etc., and open-source SDK and API services will be provided. The APPs based on these protocols and services can realize a free online society, independent of any traditional identity, account, credit, and management systems. This world is called as Freeverse.

Based on the same public-private key algorithm, Freecash can collaborate with various crypto ecosystems of the BTC framework and ETH framework. Anyone with addresses of BTC, ETH, BNB, DOGE, LTC, TRX, BCH, BSV, XEC, and similar blockchains can use Freecash's social services.

In Freeverse, CoinDays provide energy for all social activities, and FCH is not only a currency but also the sole source of CoinDays.
